# Hyperspectral-Image-Preprocessing
The current project is a simple introductory code to hyperspectral image processing using Matlab. The code is specifically valid for EO-1 Hyperion images. The code does simple pre-processing of hyperspectral image and display it in different visual format. It also shows the infrared bands which indicates vegetation.
